Terraform module that creates an RKE cluster, meant to serve as nothing but a highly-available Rancher "master" cluster

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this module is to give an easy way to stand up a production-ready Rancher "master" cluster. It is intended to be a "turn-key" module, so it includes (almost) everything needed to have Rancher up and running, including the AWS compute infrastructure, Kubernetes cluster, load balancer, Route53 DNS entry, and the Rancher deployment itself.

### High-level design

#### Resources provisioned

- [x] 3 "node groups" of EC2 instances - gives you the ability to upgrade the AMI of one node group at a time so you can do an in-place upgrade
  - Does not use AutoScalingGroups (yet) - There's a bit of "chicken and egg" problem with the initial standup of a Rancher Server cluster. Worker clusters can use ASGs, but it isn't as easy to dynamically join instances to the master cluster
  - Currently creates Ubuntu nodes with Docker installed since that is what others that have come before have done, but the desire is to switch to CentOS with optional use of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) because of its greater support for automated security tools that are commonly used in the federal government.
- [x] A Kubernetes cluster installed on the EC2 instances
  - Uses the Terraform RKE provider
  - Labels all nodes with `["controlplane", "etcd", "worker"]` - Remember this cluster should be used as the Rancher master cluster and nothing else
- [x] A Classic Load Balancer (ELB) with listeners on port 80 and port 443 that points to port 80 and 443 of the cluster nodes
- [x] 2 Security Groups
  - The `nodes` security group is used by the EC2 instances and allows:
    - Any traffic inside its own security group
    - SSH traffic from anywhere
    - K8s API traffic from anywhere
    - Traffic on ports 80 and 443 from the `elb` security group
  - The `elb` security group is used by the load balancer and allows:
    - Traffic on ports 80 and 443 from anywhere
- [x] An AWS Key Pair with a new TLS private key
- [x] A Route53 record that configures a dnsName to point at the ELB
- [x] Uses a `local-exec` to `helmfile apply` CertManager and Rancher Server

### Limitations

1. At the moment, this module cannot be deployed to private subnets. Deploying to private subnets can be added later if desired.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Terraform v0.13+ - Uses the new way to pull down 3rd party providers.
1. \*nix operating system - Windows not supported. If you need to use this on Windows you can run it from a Docker container.
1. Since this module uses a `local-exec`, the following tools also need to be installed on the machine using this module:
   1. [kubectl][kubectl]
   1. [helm][helm]
   1. [helmfile][helmfile]
   1. [helm-diff plugin][helm-diff]

### Instructions

#### Complete Example

See [examples/complete](examples/complete) for an example of how to use this module. For your convenience a Taskfile has been provided to be used with [go-task][go-task].

```sh
cd examples/complete
task plan
task apply
task destroy
```

> There are a few parameters that are specific to your AWS account and your domain name you want to use that are not included in the example `terraform.tfvars`. You should create a `override.tfvars` file and add the missing parameters to that.

#### Provider config

This module uses provider aliases, so you have to explicitly pass in provider configurations. Here's a minimum example:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

provider "random" {}

provider "tls" {}

provider "rke" {
  debug = true
}

provider "rancher2" {
  alias     = "bootstrap"
  api_url   = "https://${var.subdomain_rancher}.${var.hosted_zone}"
  insecure  = false
  bootstrap = true
}

module "rke_rancher_master_cluster" {
  source                          = "git::https://path/to/repo.git?ref=tags/x.y.z"
  additional_tag_map              = {}
  instance_type                   = var.instance_type
  kubernetes_version              = var.kubernetes_version
  name                            = var.name
  namespace                       = var.namespace
  node_group_1_subnet_id          = var.node_group_1_subnet_id
  node_group_2_subnet_id          = var.node_group_2_subnet_id
  node_group_3_subnet_id          = var.node_group_3_subnet_id
  node_volume_size                = var.node_volume_size
  stage                           = var.stage
  vpc_id                          = var.vpc_id
  hosted_zone                     = var.hosted_zone
  subdomain_rancher               = var.subdomain_rancher
  rancher_letsencrypt_email       = var.rancher_letsencrypt_email
  rancher_letsencrypt_environment = var.rancher_letsencrypt_environment
  providers = {
    aws                = aws
    random             = random
    tls                = tls
    rke                = rke
    rancher2.bootstrap = rancher2.bootstrap
  }
}
```

#### Logging into Rancher

The module outputs variables `rancher_endpoint` and `rancher_admin_password`. The username is `admin`. The admin password is managed by Terraform, don't change it manually.

## Contributing

Contributors to this module should make themselves familiar with this section.

### Prerequisites

- Terraform v0.13+
- [pre-commit][pre-commit]
- Pre-commit hook dependencies
  - nodejs (for the prettier hook)
  - [tflint][tflint]
  - [terraform-docs][terraform-docs]
  - [tfsec][tfsec]
- Run `pre-commit install` in root dir of repo (installs the pre-commit hooks so they run automatically when you try to do a git commit)

Using the [ASDF][asdf] version manager is highly encouraged. The project supports it by using a `.tool-versions` file to specify the versions of tools used and ensure that all necessary tools are installed.

See [this Gist][add-asdf-plugins.sh] for a quick way to add a set of plugins that will work for this project

### Versioning

This module will use SemVer, and will stay on v0.X for the foreseeable future
